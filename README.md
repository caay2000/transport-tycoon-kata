# Project achieved

This project has been cancelled, and it won't be updated again! I just leave it here to be able to review again some 
interesting snippets (`QueryBus`, `HTTP simulator`, `InMemoryDatabase`, `DDD concepts`) created while working on this kata!

I created a new project related with this kata, you can find it in my repositories (https://github.com/caay2000/transport-madness-kata)

# Transport Tycoon Kata

This is a kata proposed by SoftwarePark. You can find the original
one [here](https://github.com/Softwarepark/exercises/blob/master/transport-tycoon.md)

I modified some parts of it, to make it different, more challenging or just make it a playground for me :)

# Transport Tycoon Exercises for DDD

This is a set of Domain-Driven Design (DDD) exercises. They take place in the universe of
the [Transport Tycoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Tycoon). It is a game "in which the player acts as an
entrepreneur in control of a transport company, and can compete against rival companies to make as much profit as
possible by transporting passengers and various goods by road, rail, sea and air."
